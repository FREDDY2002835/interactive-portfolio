             Hey 🖐🏾! <br>
            As a learner with a passion for <a style="color:  blue;"
            href="http://www.code-blossom.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Code Blossom</a>,
            I've always been driven by a desire to <strong>learn coding</strong>. <br>
            Growing up, i had everything needed to learn <strong>code</strong>but as 
            any other normal children playing was the major activity i could do. <br>
            One time i wacthed a movie in which i saw a boy who was very good at manipulating
            <strong>computers</strong>. <br> This early spark ignited a fire within me ,
            and i knew i wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to creating informatic programs. <br>
        
            Troughout my journey, i've been fortunate to have had mentors that have 
            helped shape my skills and perspective . <br> i used to code with python 
            as you know python is programming language designed in building mobile 
            Applications ,<br> This experience  not only taught me but also solidified my 
            passion for <strong>coding</strong>.

            As i continued to grow and develop my skills , <a  style="color:blue;"
            href="http://www.code-blossom.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Code Blossom</a>
            gave me an opportunity to learn more. <br> I began to realize that beyond 
            coding with python , there is something else . This led me to pursuit my 
            path which has been an incredible journey . <br>

            Today, i'm proud to say that i'm a student with a focus on <strong>Web Development</strong>. 
            I'm excited to continue learning and growing, and i'm greatful for the oppertunity
            that lie ahead. When i'm not studying, you can find me <strong>Playing Guitar, singing</strong>. 
            I am always looking to connect with <strong>like-minded individuals</strong>
            and explore new opportunities, so feel free to reach out and say <strong>Hello!🙂</strong>
